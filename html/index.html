<H3>What is lucre?</H3>

<P>lucre is an implementation (in C++ and Java) of David Wagner's
Diffie-Hellman variant on Chaumian blinding. This variant is thought to
be unprotected by patents, however, you use it at your own risk.</P>

<P>For a detailed explanation, see <A HREF=theory2.pdf>theory2.pdf</A>.</P>

In case you are wondering what on Earth blinding is good for, the answer
is (at least): anonymous digital money and other untraceable
transactions.

is extremely open, reasonable and flexible, and we doubt you will have
any issues with it.<P>
