bank-new <key length> <bank private file> <bank public file>

	 Create a bank. The stuff you should guard with your life is
	 added to <bank private file> and the stuff you can give to
	 Joe Public ends up in <bank public file>.

coin-request <bank public file> <coin private file> <coin request>

	 Create a coin (or at least, a request for one. What is
	 sometimes known as a protocoin). The <bank public file> is
	 the bank info generated by bank-new. The <coin private file>
	 is the bit that will be worth money once the bank has signed
	 stuff. The <coin request> is what the bank will sign.

bank-sign <bank private file> <coin request> <coin signature>

	 Having received a coin request, the bank signs it (after due
	 deliberation, of course). Here's how it does it. <coin
	 signature> is what you send back to the victim, err,
	 customer.

coin-unblind <bank public file> <coin private file> <coin signature> <coin>

	 Now that the bank believes we are worth something, we've got
	 a <coin signature> back from it. Here's how we convert that,
	 plus other bits, to an actual blinded <coin>.

bank-verify <bank private file> <coin>

	 Naturally, a <coin> is worth nothing unless the bank will
	 stand behind it. This is how you check the coin isn't crap.
